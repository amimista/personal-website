## ðŸ¤”Â Warmup

```java
GrowableArray<Student> students = ...;
GrowableArray<TA> tas = ...;
// public void addAll(GrowableArray<T> other { ... }
students.add(tas);
```

- Does this make sense to do?
    - No. `students.add(tas)` will come out with a compile error since it canâ€™t pass in another `GrowableArray`
- How do we fix it to work as we expect?
    - Change the `students.add(tas)` to `students.addAll(tas)`
    - We also need to change the signature of `addAll` toâ€¦
        
        ```java
        public void addAll(GrowableArray<? extends T> other)
        ```
        
- Consider this:

```java
// sort (Comparaotr<T> cmp)
tas.sort(new StudentComparator())
```

- Should it work? What do you think will happen?
    - Dunno. Canâ€™t see the actual contents of the comparator. But the syntax looks fine.

## Abstract Data Types

- An ADT is basically a language-agnostic term for an interface
- We specify the operations we need to perform on our data and what theyâ€™re supposed to return. â€”  **we donâ€™t implement any of the actual methods or operations**
- The classes that uses these ADTs are considered **data structures.** These are in a separate class/ file from the ADT declaration.
- Examples
    - `Collection<T>`
    - `Iterable<T>`
        - Directly related to the for each methods while **iterating** through an ArrayList.
    - `Set<T>`
        - `boolean add(T t)` **returns** true if t wasnâ€™t in the set already.
        - `boolean contains(T t)`
        - `boolean remove(T t)` **returns** true if t was there and we removed it
        - `Iterator<T>`
    - `Map<K,V>`
        - Key value pair
        - `V get(K k)` get value associated with k
        - `void set (K k, V v)`
        - `boolean remove(K k)`
        - Not really a way to get a value in maps (because it uses hash codes to index itâ€™s values. ðŸ‘¹
