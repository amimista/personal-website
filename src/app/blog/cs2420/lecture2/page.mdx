### Warmup

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] arr = new int[] {1, 2};
    addOne(arr);
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
}

public static void addOne(int[] x) {
    x[0]++;
}
```

What do you think it would print out considering that the original structure of the array `arr` is `[1, 2]`?

- 🧑‍💻 Output:
    
    ```bash
    [2, 2]
    ```
    
    - It's like this because the array is taking up one place in the memory heap. The integers inside can be changed

---

### Parameter and Memory References

If the given code snippet is run, what will it output?

Don't worry about the `java.awt.Point` before each element, which is also omitted in the output.

```java
Point p = new Point(5, 10);
Point[] points = new Point[5];
    for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
    points[i] = p;
}
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(points));
p.x++;
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(points));
```

- 🧑‍💻 Output:
    
    ```bash
    [[x=5,y=10], [x=5,y=10], [x=5,y=10], [x=5,y=10], [x=5,y=10]]
    [[x=6,y=10], [x=6,y=10], [x=6,y=10], [x=6,y=10], [x=6,y=10]]
    ```
    
    - Why is that? It's because each of the indices in the array are referencing the same object. You change the object itself, **everything** changes.
    

A better way of implementing this would be to use a copy constructor. This essentially just makes a new object with the same values passed in the constructor.

```java
points = new Point[5];
for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
    points[i] = new Point(p);
}
```

### Generic Methods

Okay, so what if you made a method that looks like this? 

This reverses the ordering of an array. It'll do this by only going half way and swapping the **nth** element and the **(arr.length - 1 - nth)**. Keep in mind that this also edits the passed in the array *directly*, and doesn't make a copy to save or return.

- This allows us to do a little less work than making a new array and iterating through it backwards.

```java
public static void reverse(int[] arr) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length / 2; i++) {
        int tmp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[(arr.length-1) - i];
        arr[(arr.length-1) - i] = tmp;
    }
}
```

Okay, yeah. Cool. Now what if we wanted to reuse that code for an array of `float`s instead? What would you do?

You wouldn't copy-and-pase, you would make what's called a **generic** method. It goes a little like this:

```java
public static <T> void reverse(T[] arr) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length / 2; i++) {
        T tmp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[(arr.length-1) - i];
        arr[(arr.length-1) - i] = tmp;
    }
}
```

You'll first notice the `<T>` in the method signature right before the return type of the method. This indicates that it's a generic method and it will be able to use any type passed into it.

So now you should be able to do this:

```java
Integer[] integerArr = new Integer[] {1, 2, 3};
Float[] floatArr = new Float[] {1.5, 2.6, 3.1};

System.out.println(Arrays.toString(reverse(integerArr)));
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(reverse(floatArr)));
```

- 🧑‍💻 Output:
    
    ```bash
    [3, 2, 1]
    [3.1, 2.6, 1.5]
    ```
