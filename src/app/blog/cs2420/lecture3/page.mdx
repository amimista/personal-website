## ðŸ¤” Warmup

```java
class Base { public void baseMethod() {} }
class Derived extends Base {
  @Override public void baseMethod() {}
  public void derivedMethod() {}
}
```

What Happens in these cases (which method versions are called)?

- Derived x1 = new Derived(); x1.baseMethod();
    
    Derived `@Override baseMethod` method
    
- Base x2 = new Derived(); x1.baseMethod();
    
    Derived `@Override baseMethod` method
    
- Base x3 = new Derived(); x1.derivedMethod();
    
    **Exception**; No method found since the type of the object is `Base`. It shows the methods/ fields that are exposed, though if you would call `baseMethod()` it'll look at the derived `baseMethod()`. **[See question 2](https://www.notion.so/Lecture-3-Inheritance-8ddeeca0f4674c0b9e4e79dbfe3f8855?pvs=21).**
    
- Derived x4 = new Base(); x4.derivedMethod();
    
    **Compile Error**; Doesn't make sense. Can't assign more specific type to a more general class.

## Generic Types

### Recap Reverse Method

```java
public static void reverse(int[] arr) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length / 2; i++) {
        int tmp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[(arr.length-1) - i];
        arr[(arr.length-1) - i] = tmp;
    }
}
```

What would I have to change to make [this](https://www.notion.so/Lecture-2-Parameter-Passing-c0c3e37a83a0495bb03822d6a1f225f3?pvs=21) work with `doubles`/`Points`/`Students` ?

### Generic Reverse Method

```java
public static <T> void reverse(T[] arr) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length / 2; i++) {
        T tmp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[(arr.length-1) - i];
        arr[(arr.length-1) - i] = tmp;
    }
}
```

- `T` is a "Generic Type" or "Type Parameter"
- It is a "Placeholder" type that is filled in when we call the method and pass an array
- `T` Can be filled be any object type

### Generic Classes

```java
public class myClass<T> {
  public add(T item) { ... }
  public T get(int index) { return ... }
}
```

- T is a placeholder type which can be any Object type.
- Making a new object of said `myClass` would go a little something like this:

```java
myClass<String> myClassObject = new myClass<>();
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Similar look to an `ArrayList` declaration.

### Comparisons with just using Object

- Java Generics work basically like using `Object`, except that the compiler will do some extra checking and automatic casting for us.
- If we just stored an `Object` then the user (or other developer) would have to cast the output to something that they can use more effectively. *Super tedious and unnecessary.*

### `Comparable<T>`

- Here's an interface that we'll use a LOT in 2420:

```java
public interface Comparable<T> {
  int compareTo(T otherObject) { ... }
}
```

- Returns a negative number if the attached object is smaller than `otherObject`.
- Returns a positive number if the attached object is bigger than `otherObject`.
- Returns a 0 if both objects are equal to each other.
- You only get one `compareTo()` per implementation for a class. **Make it a good one.** Use unique values to do the comparisons.
    - i.e. Student IDs

### `Comparator<T>`

```java
public interface Comparator<T> {
  int compare(T o1, T o2) { ... }
}
// in a whole new class, but could a sub-class too.
public class FirstNameComparator implements Comparator<Name> {
  public int compare(Name n1, Name n2) {
    return n1.getFirst().compareTo(n2.getFirst());
  }
}
// somewhere else (probably in a main method)
ArrayList<Name> names = ...;
Collections.sort(names, new FirstNameComparator());
```

***OR***

```java
Collections.sort(names, (Name o1, Name o2) -> o1.compareTo(o2)); // lambda
```

- You'd use a *lambda* for simple comparisons. `[Collections.sort()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/collections-sort-java-examples/)` passes in a comparator to customize how you'd like to sort the collection.
    - Collections are [Lists](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html), [Maps](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html), and [Sets](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Set.html). All of which will be covered in later lectures.
